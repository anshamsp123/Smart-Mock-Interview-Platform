# AI-Powered Mock Interview System

## 📌 Overview
The **AI-Powered Mock Interview System** is an intelligent interview preparation platform designed to simulate real-world interview scenarios and provide **personalized, data-driven feedback** to candidates.  

The system leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **computer vision concepts**, **sentiment analysis**, and **data visualization**, accelerated by **Groq AI’s low-latency inference**, to evaluate user responses and deliver actionable insights in near real-time.

This project focuses on **preparation and skill development**, unlike traditional AI interview tools that are recruiter-centric.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional mock interviews are:
- Time-consuming
- Subjective
- Not scalable
- Lacking detailed feedback

This project aims to solve these limitations by providing an **automated, scalable, and intelligent mock interview platform** that helps users improve communication, confidence, and response quality.
